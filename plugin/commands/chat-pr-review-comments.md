# Address Github pull request comments:

1. You are given a feature branch name: $ARGUMENTS for which you should check PR pull request comments and resolve them by fixing the code.
2. Check if you're already on that branch, if not checkout: `gh pr checkout [id]`
If the user does not have the gh CLI, use git commands with users' ssh key (see ~/.ssh/config).

3. Get comments on PR
```bash
gh api --paginate repos/[owner]/[repo]/pulls/[id]/comments | jq '.[] | {user: .user.login, body, path, line, original_line, created_at, in_reply_to_id, pull_request_review_id, commit_id}'
```

4. For EACH comment, do the following. Remember to address one comment at a time.
  4a. Print out the following: "(index). From [user] on [file]:[lines] — [body]"
  4b. Analyze the file and the line range.
  4c. If you don't understand the comment, do not make a change. Just ask me for clarification, or let me implement it myself.
  4d. If you think you can make the change, make the change BEFORE moving onto the next comment.
  4e. When you write comment or summary of resolved issues, do not use icons!

5. After all comments are processed, summarize what you did, and which comments need my attention.
6. Try to resolve the comment and again run search for remaining comments to resolve them!
7. Ask user to push the changes by squashing commits and force pushing to have single commit on that PR for review!
